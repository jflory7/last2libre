Contributing to last2libre
==========================

These guidelines instruct how to set up a development environment and submit contributions to last2libre.
For any contributions, make sure to follow these steps to save time, get your changes reviewed faster, and to have a smooth experience!


## Set up a development environment

last2libre uses [pipenv](https://pipenv.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) to manage dependencies.

Improved documentation will come once last2libre v1.0.0 is packaged correctly.
Until this, the development environment is fluid and depends on personal preference.
Once a workflow is established, firmer recommendations will be set.


## How to make a contribution

These steps will be documented along with the v1.0.0 release.
Until then, the project is mostly a single-minded set of work by @jwflory.
